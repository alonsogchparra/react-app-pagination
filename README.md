This project will show you the different ways you could handle the pagination. Ih this oportunity you have two choices a custom one and another one with MUI. This project I used MUI as UI tool for React.

To run the project you first need to clone or download it, after that once you are located in the folder project on the terminal you have to run this command

```
yarn install
```

This will download all the dependencies of this project and after that you can run the project with this command

```
yarn start
```

Besides the examples on the project you can check how I handled both cases for the pagination part. I hope this help you in your personal or professional projects.
